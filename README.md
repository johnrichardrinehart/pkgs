# Description

Sometimes I run into software that I want packaged with
[nix](https://nixos.org) but I'm too lazy to open _another_ pull request to
[nixos/nixpkgs](https://github.com/nixos/nixpkgs). This repo will serve as a
place for me to package software that I want to use. Periodically, I'll try to
open up PRs upstream against `nixpkgs` to make this work available for the
broader community. Feel free as a passerby to take whatever information you
would like from this repo, though.
